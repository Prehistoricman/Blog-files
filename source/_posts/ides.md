#Sublime Vs Visual Studio

Visual Studio is an IDE ( integrated development environment ), aka it's more than just a text editor. It's a whole environment for writing code, with breakpoints and error codes, and plenty of features. Very snazzy. If you like looking at controls more complicated than an airplane, then this is for you. 

But, chances are you're not a pilot and you don't need a really complex program. So a text editor is just fine. Notepad++ would work, but it looks a bit nasty. If you just want basic features, and not to be distracted by a plethora of things to do, then a text editor. Use it. Sublime is by far the prettiest.
