#JavaScript Engine : V8

A JavaScript engine is 
> "...a virtual machine, that interprets and executes JavaScript... most commonly used in web browsers..."

V8 has been around since 2008, created by Google and is still currently supported. In fact, the last stable release wasn't even a month ago. 

It's for Chrome, and it compiles machine code before it executes it rather than interpreting it first. It makes the code more optimised, which is nice.

It's a nice feature, that many other languages don't have.
