####The trip to Bletchley Park

The trip to Bletchley Park was absolutely fantastic. I could've spent many more hours there if I had the time, but unfortunately that was not the case.

There were computational wonders in that place - The National Museum of Computing - the *WITCH*, the oldest running computer that was used to crack Hitler's top secret code that was *even more* complicated than Enigma that just so happened to be the size of a room. BBC's original home computer where we created a little snake type game using instructions similar to the magazines people used to get to play games, where you could basically add 'DLC' by spending more time on the code or fiddle with other bits and pieces to make the game your own. Guided tours where the volunteer guides lead us through the complex and explained how each and every bit worked, where the CPU (about my size) was and how the RAM (far, far bigger than my size) worked. Humongous hard disks which weigh enough to make working as a computer operator as physically intensive as a gym rat, which held **2 megabytes** of data. And of course Mario Kart 64 to muck around with at the end along with Pong, Space Invaders and others.

It was such a brilliant trip and I encourage everyone to go see them, and donate any junk you're thinking about chucking!
