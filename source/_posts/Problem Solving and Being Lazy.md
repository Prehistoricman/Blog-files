###Problem solving
Problems can be divided into smaller tasks that serve to make your task in solving the problem easier. These sub-tasks should be refined to be the smallest possible part of the problem, so that you can see your progress and how far into the problem you are.

###Being lazy
Being lazy is about doing as feasible little work. You aren't aiming to do the bare minimum, like not hashing passwords and storing them with plaintext. Doing this, for example, will mean you need to merge your database in the future to use hashed passwords.

So, doing a lot of work right now may solve you a lot of issues later on. There may be a great and easy soltuion for one of your sub-problems, but it may make another problem a real headache to implement. So you need to identify a most averagely lazy solution to all your problems when solving a sub-problem. An optimally lazy solution.

If you aim is to solve the problem only, then don't bother re-writing code. If somebody else has done it before, copy their work (if you are allowed) and use that. It's probably going to be less buggy than the code you will write first time, and copying and pasting is extremely easy. For example, if a sub-problem was to work out the nth number of the Fibonacci sequence, don't write your own code for it, creating your own sub-problems and making silly mistakes. Code published online is more likely to be:
1. Efficient
2. Working
3. Done already!
