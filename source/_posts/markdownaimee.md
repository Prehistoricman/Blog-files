Really can't be bothered with <brackets> after </braces> of wonderful HTML?
Still want to incorporate a little HTML? 
Want tables, and titles, without hassle?

**_Use markdown._**

It's easy, it can be read by a human quickly, written quickly, and read by a machine as well. I only discovered it, and I can use it already. It's ridiculously easy to master. Practically idiot proof.

Here's a [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
